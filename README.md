This TODO app made by React class component. In this project my Container.js is my Parent Component where I initialize all the state and events and pass those event and state to the class component.
The Whole project is divided into 3 components. First one Container.js( This is my parent component for this project), Second one Todo-input.js ( This file contains one input field and one submitting button and here I create and a ref method for input field and Todo-List.js third component where I kept Todo Content and one edit and delete button.
As because I use map method to render the Input field value so I have to use unique key for each values. So for the unique key I used uuid module.


//Files:-   UUID:-  npm uuid --save
            Icons:- npm install react-icons --save
